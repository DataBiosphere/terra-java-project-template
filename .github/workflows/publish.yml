  #
  # Hey! You'll probably want to adjust below this point: it deploys newly published versions to dev!
  #
  # You'll need to create a new chart entry in Beehive first, at https://broad.io/beehive/charts/new (chart 
  # names can't be changed, so be sure beforehand). Replace 'javatemplate' below with whatever name you choose.
  #
  # You'll also need to add some access to your new repo to allow it to run these steps. We have docs on the
  # whole process here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lkUkN2KOpHKWufaqw_RIE7EN3vN4G2xMnYBU83gi8VA/edit#heading=h.ipfs1speial
  #
  # Lastly, the deployment part won't work until your app has an actual chart and is deployed in dev. We can
  # help with that, ping #dsp-devops-champions and we can point you in the right direction.

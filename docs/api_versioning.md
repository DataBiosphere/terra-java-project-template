We have taken inspiration for our API versioning standards from the [Google cloud API versioning scheme](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning). While not exactly identical, for practical purposes it is.

APIs shall be versioned per interface. An interface is a logical collection of endpoints which can be viewed as a singular entity. A service might implement multiple interfaces. In terms of the correct granularity for an interface, think of it as something which would make sense for a single service to implement. As an example, Cromwell has endpoints both for workflow submission & manipulation but also reading from the metadata store. These could be seen as two separate interfaces as one could imagine a service dedicated to reading from the metadata store.

Versions shall be bumped on any breaking, non-backwards compatible change. In [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) terms, these would be for major version changes. Unless we encounter reasons to diverge we shall follow the [Google definition of compatibility](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/compatibility). Versions are expected to change infrequently, with every effort made to integrate required functionality in an additive fashion.

URLs shall take the form INTERFACE/vVERSION/path. For example: `/api/example/v1/message` where `/api/example` is the interface, `v1` is the version and `message` is the path.
